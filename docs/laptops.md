# Laptops

Seal talks to the HP BIOS mailbox (`hpqBIntM`), which every OMEN and Victus laptop exposes. What differs
between models is which commands the firmware answers and which bytes each performance mode wants. That is
the only model-specific thing in the app, and it lives in one table: [`src/Platform.cs`](../src/Platform.cs).

## The two states

Every OMEN and Victus laptop is **supported**, and there is no "unsupported" list. A board nobody has ever seen
still runs: Seal reads the firmware's own system-design data, works out which generation it is, and drives it
with the mode bytes documented for that generation. Power, GPU and lighting appear only where the firmware
answers for them. If it answers with nothing usable, Seal stays read-only and says so in the window.

A model becomes **verified** once somebody has run the checklist below on that exact board and every control
did what it says. Its settings are then fixed rather than worked out at run time.

## The boards

One table per firmware generation, because the generation is what decides the mode bytes. Marketing names
are approximate: HP reuses a board across several SKUs, so the board id is the only thing that identifies a
machine exactly.

**A ✓ marks a board an owner has confirmed.** Everything else still runs, Seal reads the firmware's own
system-design data and drives the board with the bytes for its generation, it has simply not been confirmed
by a person yet. See [Verifying your laptop](#verifying-your-laptop), it takes five minutes.

`8C58` is the reference machine: Core Ultra 9 185H + RTX 4070, checked byte for byte against OMEN Gaming Hub
1101.2608, which is where the mode bytes, the fan curve and the GPU payloads in `src/Platform.cs` come from.

### Victus

Victus firmware uses different mode bytes from OMEN: `0x00` default, `0x01` performance, `0x03` quiet. Seal
writes those bytes only for the boards the Linux `hp-wmi` driver names, because that is the only place they
are written down:

| Model | Board ids | Mode bytes |
|---|---|---|
| Victus 16 (2021–2023) | `88F8`, `8A25` ✓ | from `hp-wmi` |
| Victus 15-fb0xxx | `8A3D` | from `hp-wmi`, no quiet mode |
| Victus 16-r0xxx | `8BC2` ✓ | OMEN bytes; `hp-wmi` lists it as OMEN despite the name |
| Victus 16 S / R (2023–2024) | `8B2F`, `8BBE` ✓, `8BD4`, `8BD5` ✓, `8C99`, `8C9C` | from `hp-wmi`, no quiet mode |
| Victus 15 and 16, other models | `88D9`, `88DA`, `88EE` ✓, `8A26` ✓, `8A3E`, `8C2F`, `8C30`, `8C3F`, `8D07`, `8DCD`, `8DCF` ✓, `8E5E` | from the firmware |

"from the firmware" is the same path every unlisted OMEN takes: Seal asks the board which firmware generation
it is and drives it with that generation's bytes. It works, and nobody has yet confirmed on a Victus 15 that
the quiet mode is the byte we think it is. The kernel's own Victus 16-r0xxx entry takes OMEN bytes despite the
name, so the badge on the lid does not decide this, only a readback from the machine does.

`8A3D` is the exception and shows how this gets settled: it is a Victus 15-fb0xxx, and it reached `hp-wmi`
in July 2026 because one owner ran the fan table query on theirs and sent the readback to the kernel list.
Board `8C2F` is reported to be shared between the 15" and 16" chassis, so even a board id is not always one
machine.

### ASUS Gaming Laptops (ROG & TUF)

ASUS laptops communicate through the ACPI `ASUS_WMI` interface (`root\wmi:ASUS_WMI`). Thermal modes map to ASUS Throttle Thermal Policy (Silent = `2`, Performance/Normal = `0`, Turbo = `1`), with support for Fan Boost, live RPM tachometers, GPU MUX switches, and CPU SPL/SPPT power limits.

| Family | Models | Board / Product IDs |
|---|---|---|
| **ROG Zephyrus** | G14, G15, G16, M16, Duo | `GA401`, `GA402`, `GA403`, `GA502`, `GA503`, `GU603`, `GU604`, `GU605`, `GX550`, `GX551`, `GX650` |
| **ROG Strix & SCAR** | Strix G15/G16/G17, SCAR 15/16/17/18 | `G512`, `G513`, `G533`, `G614`, `G634`, `G712`, `G713`, `G733`, `G814`, `G834` |
| **ROG Flow** | Flow X13, Z13, X16 | `GV301`, `GV302`, `GZ301`, `GV601` |
| **TUF Gaming** | TUF A15/A16/A17, TUF F15/F16/F17/Dash | `FA506`, `FA507`, `FA617`, `FA706`, `FA707`, `FX506`, `FX507`, `FX607`, `FX706`, `FX707`, `FX516`, `FX517` |
| **Other ASUS Models** | All other ASUS gaming laptops | Dynamic profile built from `ASUS_WMI` |

### Acer Gaming Laptops (Predator & Nitro)

Acer laptops communicate through Acer Gaming WMI (`root\wmi:Acer_WMIData` / `Acer_WMI_Interface`) and Embedded Controller registers. Thermal profiles map to Quiet (`0`), Default/Normal (`1`), and Extreme/Turbo (`2`), with CoolBoost max fan support.

| Family | Models | Board / Product IDs |
|---|---|---|
| **Predator Helios** | Helios 16, 18, 300, 500, 700, Neo 16 | `PH16`, `PH18`, `PH315`, `PH317`, `PH517`, `PH717` |
| **Predator Triton** | Triton 14, 16, 17, 300, 500 | `PT14`, `PT16`, `PT17`, `PT314`, `PT315`, `PT515`, `PT516` |
| **Nitro Series** | Nitro 5, Nitro 16, Nitro 17, Nitro V 15/16 | `AN515`, `AN517`, `AN16`, `AN17`, `ANV15`, `ANV16` |
| **Other Acer Models** | All other Acer gaming laptops | Dynamic profile built from Acer WMI & EC |

### A note on v0 boards

The v0 byte set has one default (`0x00`), one performance (`0x01`) and one cool (`0x02`), there is no
separate low-power byte, so **Eco and Balanced are the same byte** and only Performance behaves differently.
This is how the firmware is documented, not a bug, and `hp-wmi` maps low power to default on these boards for
the same reason. Turning on **quieter Eco** in Settings makes Eco send `0x02` instead, which does differ.

Board `8EEC` is a 2026 machine that still reports v0, so this is not only an old-laptop concern.

## Finding your board id

Open Seal and look at the top right of **Settings**, or run:

```
(Get-CimInstance Win32_BaseBoard).Product
```

## Verifying your laptop

This takes about five minutes and it is the most useful thing you can contribute.

1. **Modes.** Switch Eco → Balanced → Performance. The fans should audibly change within a few seconds, and
   the chassis reading on the Home page should drift. If nothing changes on any mode, say so.
2. **Fans.** Try Max (both fans should go loud), then Manual (set 50%, the reading should land near half of
   your maximum), then Curve (drag a point up, the fans should follow within one ramp delay), then Auto.
3. **Power gain.** If the row is there, move it to +15 W and check that nothing throttles or resets.
4. **GPU power.** If the row is there, try each of Base / Boost / Max.
5. **Graphics.** If your machine offers Discrete or iGPU only, *do not* switch it unless you are willing to
   restart. If you do, confirm it comes back correctly.
6. **Lighting.** If your keyboard lights, check that the zones in the app match the zones on the keyboard,
   and that Static, Breathe, Cycle and Wave all do something.
7. **Driver (optional, but the most useful single thing on a new board).** Settings → Driver → Install. Then run
   `tools\drivertest.cmd`. It says whether the CPU's own registers answer on your chip, and whether your
   embedded controller is laid out the way the map expects, the line to look for is `ec fan rpm` beside
   `mailbox 0x2D`, which should agree within a few percent. Attach `tools\drivertest.txt` too. Nothing is
   written to your EC either way; the check is read-only.
8. **Exit.** Close Seal and confirm the fans return to the firmware's own behaviour within two minutes and
   nothing is stuck.

Then run:

```
tools\support-info.cmd
```

and open a [Verify my laptop](https://github.com/sahilneverdies/Seal/issues/new?template=verify-laptop.yml) issue
with `tools\support-info.txt` attached and a line per step above. The file contains the model, board id, BIOS
version, the firmware's system-design bytes, the fan table and the OMEN key event id. No personal data, no
serial numbers.

## If your keyboard lights per key

HP's firmware lighting interface answers on these boards and drives nothing at all, so Seal uses the
keyboard's own HID lighting interface instead. That part is written against a published standard but is
**unverified**: nobody working on Seal has a per-key machine. Run this, which writes nothing and changes
nothing:

```
Seal.exe --lamps
```

and open an issue with what it prints. It reports how many lamps your keyboard has, where each one is, and
which key each one lights. That is everything needed to confirm the feature works.

## If a control is wrong on your model

Open a [New laptop support](https://github.com/sahilneverdies/Seal/issues/new?template=new-laptop-support.yml) issue
with the same file, what OMEN Gaming Hub shows for the same control, and, if you can get it, OGH's own
background log from a session where you clicked every mode:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\AD2F1837.OMENCommandCenter_v10z8vjag6ke6\LocalCache\Local\HPOMEN\
```

That log is what made the Transcend 14 profile exact, and it is the fastest route to an exact profile for any
other model.

## Adding a laptop in code

A laptop is one entry in `Platforms.Known` in [`src/Platform.cs`](../src/Platform.cs):

```csharp
new PlatformProfile {
    Name = "HP OMEN 16 (2023, 16-wf0xxx)",
    Boards = new[] { "8BAA" },
    Notes  = "Verified 2026-09-10 against OGH 1101.x logs."
}
```

Everything else (fan ranges, mode bytes, which features exist) either has a sane default on
`PlatformProfile` or is read from the firmware at run time. Override only what the evidence says is
different, and put the evidence in `Notes`.
